# Programmer: Zam Nwosu
# Input: 1) Amount of numbers 2) The number file name 3) Users guess of highest number
# Process: 1) Important random numbers 2) Sort the numbers as a list 3) Find the highest number in the list
# Output: 1) Tell user if their guess is wrong or right 2) Ask user if they want to try again
